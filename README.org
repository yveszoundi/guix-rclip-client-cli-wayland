#+TITLE: README

Test repository to understand few concepts.

* What is this?

I'm just experimenting with [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Rust-Crates.html][Guix packaging]] of applications written in the [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] programming language.
- *This is for Wayland only (Linux)*
- This is command-line only
- This is meant to be deployed on a [[https://guix.gnu.org/][Gnu Guix System]] environment

* How do I build it?

#+begin_src sh
  guix environment -l guix.scm
  CC=gcc cargo build
#+end_src

* How do I install it?

You can install the application by running the command below.

#+begin_src sh
  guix package -f guix.scm
#+end_src

* How do I run it?

You can invoke the command =rclip-client-cli -h= and display available options.

For more information, please visit the [[https://github.com/yveszoundi/rclip][official GitHub project page]] of this application.
